DochBlock is just hacked together from
[WebsiteBlocker](https://github.com/WesleyBranton/Website-Blocker) and the lists
of websites from 
[ByeRupert](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2014/12/bye-rupert-chrome-extension-blocks-all-news-corp-australia-sites/)

Thanks to Wesley Branton for the code and Mat Carpenter for the site list. They
did most of the work.

If you want to add extra urls, edit the list in XXX file link XXX and make a
pull request. That way we all get to use the updates.
