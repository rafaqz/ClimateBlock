DochBlock is a Firefox plugin for blocking climate-change denying Rupert Murdoch websites, and anything else that he owns.

It's just hacked together from
[WebsiteBlocker](https://github.com/WesleyBranton/Website-Blocker) and the lists
of websites from 
[ByeRupert](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2014/12/bye-rupert-chrome-extension-blocks-all-news-corp-australia-sites/)

Thanks to Wesley Branton for the code and Mat Carpenter for the site list. They
did most of the work.

If you want to add extra urls, edit the firefox/sites.js file and make a
pull request. That way we all get to use the updates.
